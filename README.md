# Etch-a-Sketch

This project is a browser-based drawing grid inspired by the classic Etch-a-Sketch toy. Users can create pixel art by hovering over grid cells, which change color on mouseover. The grid size can be customized, and each square progressively darkens with repeated mouse interactions.

## Features
- Dynamic Grid: The grid can be resized (between 16x16 and 100x100) based on user input.
- Random Colors: Each square gets a random color the first time it is hovered over.
- Darkening Effect: Every time a square is hovered over again, it darkens by 10% until it reaches black.
- Responsive Design: The grid adjusts based on the selected size while maintaining a consistent total container size (700px).

## How to Use
1. Open the webpage in your browser.
2. Hover over the grid to start drawing. Each cell will be assigned a random color that darkens with each hover.
3. Click the **"Resize"** button to change the grid size.
4. Enter the number of squares per side (*between 16 and 100*) to create a new grid.
